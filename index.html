Fall is the season for all senses. The feel of cooler temperatures after a long summer. 
A warm, visually pleasing palate of reds, oranges and browns. The taste of pumpkin spice in everything. 
The sound of crunching leaves underfoot. The smell of woodsmoke. The many elements of autumn either intrinsically 
deliver happiness or trigger memories of past joy from which we can keep taking bites, as from a freshly baked apple pie.
While we celebrate the seasonal joys, we should remind ourselves that they are blazes on a trail that goes deep into a 
beautiful forest of wisdom and meaning. Like spring, fall is a season of transition, a reminder of the value of change, 
in this case from bright, buzzing, verdant summer toward the dark, quiet calm of winter. It's a journey inward; first experiential,
then intellectual and finally into the collective unconscious.

The most boring article about writing you’ll ever read: That’s the title of this article and I wouldn’t blame you for thinking it 
was clickbait. But, I’m going to tell you something that might surprise you: not all writing advice articles are terrible. In fact, 
some of them can be quite useful! If they seem boring at first glance, it’s probably because they’re authored by writers who know that
most people won’t read an article about let’s say “editing” unless it’s engaging and funny. The following is the most boring article about
writing you will ever read. It may even be longer than any other boring article about writing. If you are looking for a fun, entertaining 
read on how to write a great novel or short story, this is not it.
